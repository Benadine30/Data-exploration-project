# Data-exploration-of US tech Layoffs
In light of the recent layoffs especially in the tech industry, I decided to explore and analyze the dataset using an MSSQL server and Microsoft Power BI


From my analysis, I discovered that the majority of the layoffs happened in January 2023 more than half of the layoffs from Jan. 2022-Jan. 2023 happened this past January and mostly in the Public sectors.

Does it mean itâ€™s safer working in the private sector than in the public sector?

Also, the top 5 companies made up at least 50% of the layoffs with Amazon topping the list. What exactly happened at Amazon that led to this massive layoff?

The E-commerce and Social Media industries made up about 25% of the total layoffs.
